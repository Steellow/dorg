# DORG

Dorg stands for Downloads Organizer. Simple but effective script to organize your Downloads folder. Dorg makes own folder for each filetype.

- Edit your username on both files
- Install inotify-tools
- chmod +x checkforfiles.sh

inotify-tools is used to check for new files in Downloads folder.

### TODO

- [ ] Add downloaded folders to their own directory
